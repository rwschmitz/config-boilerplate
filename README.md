# Boilerplate Linting and Code Formatting

## Current Version: 1.0.2

## Last Updated: 02-22-2020

### Description

I got really tired of looking through old projects to find a suitable eslint setup for TypeScript. I also got really tired of looking through old projects for a prettier setup. Too many of these setups were mixed and matched from google searches across the years and just became completely unwieldy.

Instead, I've made my own that I'll be able to reference going forward.

### Guidelines

- This repository will always be the most up to date reference of all my config files.
- This repository will have both a README and CHANGELOG.
- Both the README and CHANGELOG will be updated with the date this repository was last updated.
- The CHANGELOG will contain reasoning behind any changes going forward.
